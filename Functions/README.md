# Python Practice Problems

This repository contains Python exercises covering various topics such as string manipulation, list statistics, and more.

## Area Calculator

**Problem Statement:**
Create a function `Calculate_area(shape, dimensions)` that takes the shape (e.g., "rectangle", "circle") and its dimensions as arguments. The function should calculate the area based on the shape and return the result. Implement logic for handling different shapes (rectangle, circle) and their corresponding dimensions (length, width for rectangle; radius for circle).

## String Manipulation

**Problem Statement:**
Create a function `reverse_words(text)` that takes a string as input. The function should reverse the order of words in the string while maintaining the order of characters within each word. Return the modified string.

## List Statistics

**Problem Statement:**
Create a function `analyze_list(numbers)` that takes a list of numbers as input. The function should calculate and return the following in a dictionary: Minimum value in the list, Maximum value in the list, Average value in the list (use sum and division). Use a dictionary to store and return the calculated statistics. Hint: Utilize built-in functions like min, max, and sum for calculations.

## Text Analyzer (Bonus Challenge)

**Problem Statement:**
Create a function `analyze_text(text)` that takes a block of text as input. The function should count the number of words in the text (split by whitespace), count the number of characters (excluding whitespaces), and find the most frequent word (you can assume case-insensitive matching for simplicity). Return a dictionary containing these counts and the most frequent word.
